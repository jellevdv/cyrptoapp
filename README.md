# Cryptoapp

This is a project I made for school. It is a crypto portfolio SPA which is made using the Angular framework. The project enables to track the price of certain coins and their change in the past 24 hours as well as a news feed with articles related to Bitcoin and the Blockchain technology. You can register as a new user to make your own portfolios. The application fetches its data from a selfmade API using .Net. The Api runs on Azure and you can find all of the possible requests at 'https://cryptoapijellevandevyvere.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html'. For the design of the site I made use of the Bulma css framework.

## example
